# ZOOJOINS

This repository contains three files. 


# FILES 

1. A database file (ZOOJOINS.db) which contains the data that is referenced from 
  SQL ZOO https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/The_JOIN_operation. 

2. A .sql file (ZOOJOINS.sql) which contains questions and solutions to each question from          https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/The_JOIN_operation

3. A .py file that contains code for reading in data to a pandas data frame and then using SQL alchemy to   move that data into SQLite database

# MOTIVATION 

SQL Zoo is great and thank you Chris Bruehl (an instructor at Metis Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp) for referencing this during this. BUT its really nice to see ALL the data in front of you so you can see it's structure. So thats why I put it in a SQLlite database for easy querying. 

Hope this helps !
